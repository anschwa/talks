* Modules Lightning Talk
Golang Indianapolis October 23, 2019

* Abstract
Go modules give some flexibility for controlling which version of a
dependency gets built in your app, however, these mechanisms are not
obvious. This talk sets out to demonstrate some of the abilities of
=replace=, =exclude=, and =go get= under modules for substituting
package versions or branches on the fly.
