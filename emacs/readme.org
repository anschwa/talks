* Emacs and the Joy of Text Editing
  indy.rb January 8, 2020

* Abstract

* What is an EMACS?
  Emacs is family of text editors. Although this distinction has become
  less relevant over time, it remains significant. Emacs is recognized
  by its *extensibility* rather than its underlying implementation.

* Some history
  - First version appeared in 1976. (Guy Steele et al.)
  - Coincidentally, Bill Joy comes up with vi this same year.
  - GNU Emacs doesn't make its first official release until 1985.
    (Richard Stallman / James Gosling)
  - Ken Thompson developed ed around 1970.

* Let's talk about line editing
  - Fluency
  - Efficiency
  - Keybindings

** Aside
   - Learn to type!
   - If you're really serious, learn Dvorak.

* What makes Emacs different?
  - Extensibility
  - Efficiency, consistency, and transparency (no surprises)
  - Kill ring (infinite undo/redo)
  - Marking (selection and navigation)
  - Buffers and frames

** Killer Features
   - Org-Mode (the best note taking system in the world)
   - Magit (the best git interface in the world)
   - Tramp (how remote file editing should be)

* Text editing as a tool for thought
  - Text is the universal interface

* Questions for consideration
 - Where do our tools impose limitations on us?
 - What limitations do we actually want?
 - What are the constraints of your environment?
 - How are you investing in your tools?
 - Are you aware of the trade-offs you are making?

* Thank You

  Show me your flowcharts and conceal your tables, and I shall continue
  to be mystified. Show me your tables, and I won’t usually need your
  flowcharts; they’ll be obvious. -- Fred Brooks
