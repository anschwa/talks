* What is an EMACS?
  Emacs is family of text editors. Although this distinction has become
  less relevant over time, it remains significant. Emacs is recognized
  by its *extensibility* rather than its underlying implementation.

* Some history
  - First version appeared in 1976. (Guy Steele et al.)
  - Coincidentally, Bill Joy comes up with vi this same year.
  - GNU Emacs doesn't make its first official release until 1985.
    (Richard Stallman / James Gosling)
  - Ken Thompson developed ed around 1970.

* Let's talk about line editing
** Fluency
   - We work with text one line at a time
   - So let's Make it as natural to manipulate as possible
   - Line editing helps eliminate the friction between getting our
     thoughts to the screen by leveraging muscle memory
   - Transforming text as we type means we are iterating on our ideas in real-time
     - Provokes us to think deeper about the problem at hand
     - Inspires new ideas
** Efficiency
   - Keybindings
     - Navigation
     - Copy & Paste
     - Upcase / Downcase
     - Undo
     - Macros

** Aside
   - Learn to type!
   - If you're really serious, learn Dvorak.

* What makes Emacs different?
  - Extensibility
  - Efficiency, consistency, and transparency (no surprises)
  - Kill ring (infinite undo/redo)
  - Marking (selection and navigation)
  - Buffers and frames

** Killer Features
   - Org-Mode (the best note taking system in the world)
   - Magit (the best git interface in the world)
   - Tramp (how remote file editing should be)

* Text editing as a tool for thought
  - Text is the universal interface

* Questions for consideration
  - Where do our tools impose limitations on us?
  - What limitations do we actually want?
  - What are the constraints of your environment?
  - How are you investing in your tools?
  - Are you aware of the trade-offs you are making?

  Show me your flowcharts and conceal your tables, and I shall continue
  to be mystified. Show me your tables, and I won’t usually need your
  flowcharts; they’ll be obvious. -- Fred Brooks
